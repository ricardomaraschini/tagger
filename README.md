# Tagger

Tagger helps keeping references to external Docker images internally  
to a Kubernetes cluster. It maps remote image `tags` into references
by `hash` and keeps track of them.

# What is a tag

TBD.

### Disclaimer

The private key present on this project is not a problem, this is
not being used anywhere yet and to keep keys in here makes *things*
easier (specially at this stage of development).
