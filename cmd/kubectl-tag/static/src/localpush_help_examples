  In order to push a locally saved image you first need to save the image
  locally. If using Docker one can run the following command:

  $ docker save -o fedora.tar fedora:latest

  If using podman one can save an image as tar by running:

  $ podman save                    \
           --format docker-archive \
	   -o fedora.tar           \
	   fedora:latest

  Once the image is saved user can then push it as a new generation for a
  Tag by running:

  $ kubectl tag localpush      \
           --file=./fedora.tar \
	   ip.or.tagger.dns.name:port/myteam/server

  This will push the locally saved tar file as a new generation for Tag
  "server" in namespace "myteam".
