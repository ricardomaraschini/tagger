Moves to the next Generation of a Tag

This command moves a Tag one Generation upwards. If a Tag has 3 
Generations (3,4 and 5) and is currently pointing to Generation 3, an
upgrade will make it point to Generation 4. Deployments leveraging
this Tag will be automatically updated.

Upon reaching the most recent Generation an upgrade has the same 
effect of an "import" (see kubectl tag help import).
