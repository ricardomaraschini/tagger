Imports an existing Tag

This commands informs tagger that a new import is needed for a given
Tag. Upon receiving this command tagger will immediatly reach the remote
registry and fetch the current image hash pointed by the Tag. 

Deployments leveraging the imported Tag will be automatically updated
to point to the new imported image and the image will be placed as the
most recent (higher) Generation of the Tag.

Important: during an import the new image is *always* placed as the most
recent Generation and the Tag starts pointing to it, regardless of the
previous Generation.
