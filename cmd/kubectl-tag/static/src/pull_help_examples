  Assuming one wants to pull an image from a Tag called "server" living 
  in "myteam" namespace one could use:

  $ kubectl tag pull ip.or.tagger.dns.name:port/myteam/server

  Once the command has been finished you must be able to see this image
  in your local storage. Important: this command always uses the tag
  "latest" when storing the image locally. The command above would
  result on the following local image.

  $ podman images
  REPOSITORY                                  TAG         IMAGE ID
  ip.or.tagger.dns.name:port/myteam/server    latest      84deeb10a26d
