  Assuming one wants to push an image into a Tag called "server" living 
  in "myteam" namespace one could use:

  $ kubectl tag push ip.or.tagger.dns.name:port/myteam/server

  Once the command has been finished you must be able to see a new
  Generation in the target tag:

  $ kubectl get -n myteam tag/server -o yaml

  Important to observe that once you issue this push Tagger will update
  the "server" Tag to point its most recent Generation to the image you
  just pushed. Redeployments may be expected as everything using the Tag
  will be affected.
