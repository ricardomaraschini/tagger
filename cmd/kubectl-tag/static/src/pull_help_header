Pulls an image from a remote tagger instance

  This command requests a remote tagger instance to forward us a certain image.
  Tagger creates a blob with the image and, on receiving, we copy it's content
  into local storage.

  This subcommand communicates directly with a tagger instance through GRPC.
  Once tagger is exposed you can pull images using tagger address as a registry
  name.
