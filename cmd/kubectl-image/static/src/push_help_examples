  Assuming one wants to push an image into a Image called "server" living 
  in "myteam" namespace one could use:

  $ kubectl image push ip.or.tagger.dns.name:port/myteam/server

  Once the command has been finished you must be able to see a new
  image reference in the target Image:

  $ kubectl get -n myteam image/server -o yaml
