  This is a valid command usage:

  kubectl image import					\
  	--from docker.io/library/fedora:latest		\
	--mirror=false					\
	--insecure-source=false				\
	-n devel					\
	fedora 

  The command above imports image docker.io/library/fedora:latest
  into an Image called fedora in the devel namespace.

  Mirror informs Tagger that we need to mirror the image into our
  mirror registry while Insecure Source informs that TLS checks
  should be omitted when reaching the remote registry.
