Pushes an image 

This subcommand pushes a local image into a Image. It leverages tagger protocol
and communicates by means of GRPC (you need to expose tagger in order to use
this). What happens here is that we first save a local image into a tar file
and later we upload this tar file into a tagger instance.

In order to push images from a Kubernetes cluster you need to be authenticated
using a token.
