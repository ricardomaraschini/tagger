# for pull request the actions context is a little bit different. we always use the workflow as
# defined in the main branch, therefore any change in .github/workflow directory introduced by
# the PR is ignored. this happens because if leverage the "on: pull_request_target" instead of
# "on: pull_request". the only practical difference here is that when we checkout the source
# code we use the source repository (the repo used to open the pr), see "check out code" steps.
